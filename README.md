# US2mask
Cardiac ultrasound (US) image segmentation plays a crucial role in evaluating clinical indices.
However, deep learning algorithms used for cardiac US image segmentation typically require a large
amount of data and expert annotation, leading to high costs. To address this issue and reduce expenses
associated with mask labeling, this study presents a framework that utilizes artificial intelligence
generation technology to generate multi-class RGB masks for cardiac US image segmentation
